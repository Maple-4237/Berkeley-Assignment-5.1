# Berkeley-Assignment-5.1
This is an assignment done while enrolled in UC Berkeley's Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those who did not.

The task was to determine who was taking the bar coupons the most out of the dataset of drivers. It was found that drivers who accepted the coupons given for bars are more likely to be younger people who has a partner but not any children. 
Further research was performed on people who accepted the coffee house coupons and whether their passanger would effect their decision. It was found that friends would cause for them to accept the coupons at least 3 times or less, while their partners would cause them to go more than 8 times.
